PANDAS MARC export prototype
============================

Creates MARC records from PANDAS titles. Currently a standalone prototype webapp.

The expected workflow is that the records will be manually edited after
importing into the ILMS to enhance them with additional data such as subjects.

Configuration
-------------

Set the following environment variables:

```sh
PANDAS_DB_URL=
PANDAS_DB_USER=
PANDAS_DB_PASSWORD=
# PORT=3001
```
